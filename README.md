# USA Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices in the USA using a machine learning model and a Django web application for the frontend. The notebook leverages various Python libraries and machine learning techniques to achieve this goal, while the Django application provides an interface for users to interact with the model.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset used in this project is the [USA Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing). Additionally, a Django application is developed to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the prediction model.
